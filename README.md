# 🐍 NLTK for Beginners: A Friendly Guide to Natural Language Processing 📚

## 🌟 What is NLTK?

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a powerful Python library that helps you work with human language data. It's perfect for beginners who want to dive into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text analysis!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

First, install NLTK using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

### Downloading Essential Resources

After installation, you'll need to download some basic resources:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## 🧰 Basic NLTK Operations

### 1. Tokenization 🔪

Tokenization is breaking text into smaller pieces:

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

text = "Hello, world! How are you today?"
words = word_tokenize(text)
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)

print("Words:", words)
print("Sentences:", sentences)
```

### 2. Stop Words Removal 🧹

Remove common words that don't add much meaning:

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
text = "This is a sample sentence, showing off the stop words filtration."
words = word_tokenize(text)
filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]

print("Original:", words)
print("Filtered:", filtered_words)
```

### 3. Stemming 🌱

Reduce words to their root form:

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

stemmer = PorterStemmer()
words = ['running', 'runs', 'runner']
stemmed_words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]

print("Original:", words)
print("Stemmed:", stemmed_words)
```

### 4. Lemmatization 🌿

Similar to stemming, but more linguistically correct:

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
words = ['running', 'runs', 'runner']
lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]

print("Original:", words)
print("Lemmatized:", lemmatized_words)
```
